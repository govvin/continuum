##About
The first Philippine [edits](http://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/491946) was made in 31st December, 2007, by [maning](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/maning). Since then, we've been involved, one way or another, in various mapping events in the Philippines - physically, or remotely.

##How to Contribute
1.  **Technical Way** To contribute, fork the project and update the calendar.geojson file and send a pull request with the changes. You can use Mapbox's nifty http://geojson.io/ project to work with the data in a browser if you are not familar with desktop Geographic Information Systems ("GIS") programs such as [QGIS] (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). 

2.  **Non-Technical Way** Submit an [issue] (https://github.com/OSMPH/events/issues) with a detailed description of the mapping event (Date, Event Type, 	Number of Attendees, Active	Contributors,	Partner/Host,	Venue,	Organizer,	Hashtag	Writeup/Blog), and if possible the latitude and longitude of the venue.
