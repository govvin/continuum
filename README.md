The first Philippine [edit](http://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/491946) was made in 31st December, 2007, by [maning](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/maning). Since then, the community members have been involved, one way or another, in various mapping activities in the Philippines - physically, or remotely, and around the world.
